This is a clone of the classes 'Frogger' game.

Move your player to cross the path of nasty bugs without being devoured and try to reach the um.. 'water' to be 'safe'!

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard:

* Up Arrow = Move Up

* Down Arrow = Move Down

* Left Arrow = Move Left

* Right Arrow = Move Right
